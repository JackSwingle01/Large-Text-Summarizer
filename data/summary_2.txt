Alice follows a White Rabbit down a rabbit-hole and finds herself in a strange world called Wonderland. She encounters various creatures, including a mouse, a caterpillar, a Cheshire Cat, and a Duchess. She attends a mad tea party with the Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse, and plays croquet with the Queen of Hearts. She also witnesses a trial where the Queen is accused of making tarts that were stolen by the Knave of Hearts. Throughout her adventures, Alice struggles to understand the nonsensical logic of Wonderland and longs to return home.
